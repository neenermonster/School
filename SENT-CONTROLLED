// MovieGuide.cpp - This program allows each theater patron to enter a value from 0 to 4 
// indicating the number of stars that the patron awards to the Guide's featured movie of the 
// week. The program executes continuously until the theater manager enters a negative number to 
// quit. At the end of the program, the average star rating for the movie is displayed.
